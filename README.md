# Introduction to Algorithms and Programming Lab @ AI Master

Introduction to Algorithms and Programming Laboratory, _A. A.2019-2020_, **Artificial Intelligence Master Degree in
Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna**.

[Professor Simone Martini](http://cs.unibo.it/~martini) helds the first part of the course, [Professor Maurizio
Gabbrielli](http://cs.unibo.it/~gabbri) helds the second part.

## Instructions to use this repository

Roughly speaking, there are two ways one can interact with this, you can download it as a `.zip` file or `clone` it as a `git` repository.

Depending on your first choice we have 3 possible situations:

- In the first case, there is one drawback (otherwise they would not have invented `git`): **YOU WOULD MISS UPDATES!!**
_The solution is that you come in this page weekly and download again the `.zip` file_.

- If you are new to `git` AND you want to learn about it, please have a look [at this document](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/), it is a brief guide on the usage of `git` with a useful _cheatsheet_ that you can print and keep with you wherever you go :laughing:

- You know everything about `git` and you basically don't need this guide :sunglasses:

### Now that we have the code, what to do next?

Again, you have 2 ways to interact with **Python Notebooks** (well, you have a million ways but, for the sake of brevity, I will show you just 2). If you know more, good for you :muscle:

- First, you can download `jupyter notebook` from the web [everything that you need is here](https://jupyter.org/install) and use it!

- Second, you can _copy and paste_ the content of `code cells` into your favorite **IDE** and execute it as usual.
  
  - **GitHub** nicely provides you a viewer for `Python Notebooks` that ease the process of _copy/paste_ (otherwise it would be just an unreadable full-of-code meaningless page).

### Important Notice

**DO NOT FORK THE REPOSITORY** unless you know what you are doing! Otherwise you will lose updates from the original fork (mine).
