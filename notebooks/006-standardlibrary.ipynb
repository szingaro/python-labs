    "Given a finite set of positive samples and a finite set of negative examples, can we build a regular expression that matches the positives but rejects the negatives? Of course! We could just explicitly include the positives and explicitly reject the negatives. However, this approach leads to regexes that are quite long. For this part, write an algorithm that approximately generates the smallest regular expression that matches a list of positive samples and rejects a list of negative samples. Our metric for smallest will default to shortest, but feel free to come up with your own metric.\n",
