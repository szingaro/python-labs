    "The primary goal of the first half is to ensure that your Python installation process went smoothly, and that there are no lingering Python installation bugs floating around.\n",

Work through as much as you can in the time allotted, but also feel free to skip from question to question freely. The extra problems are intended to be extra practice, if you want to hone your Python skills even more.**\n",
