    This iterative approach will work really well, and if it gets the job done

        return sum([i for i in range(n) if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0])

    compressing the syntax of an iterative for loop into one line - no big changes
    except for the use of `sum`.

    Another approach, as we'll learn about soon, is to use `filter`:

def object_reference():
    """Explore the differences between objects and references to objects

    What's happening here? Lists store references to objects, and any operation which
    updates the underlying object in-place (like += on lists, which is equivalent to .extend)
    will change the object that all of the list entries point to. For strings and integers,
    adding a number won't update the underlying object in place, so only the first elements
    are changed. In fact, both strings and integers in Python are "immutable," in the sense
    that all modification operations (like .lower(), .upper(), etc) will create (and return!)
    a new object (a new suitcase).

    Visually, it looks something like this (forgive the ASCII art):

        s = [[]]

        # s[0] ----->  []    s[0] points to one list object

        s *= 3

        # s[0] __
        #        \\
        # s[1] ---==>  []    All three indices point to the same (individual!) list object!
        #         /
        # s[2] __/

        s[0].append(1)

        # s[0] __
        #        \\
        # s[1] ---==>  [1]   The update reflects across all list indices.
        #         /
        # s[2] __/

    Since all the elements of the list are references to the (one and only) list object that
    has been updated in place to contain a 1, printing `s` reflects this change across all of its indices.

    Bonus! Setting one of the elements of `s` to point to a new object will change this structure.
    For example,

        s[0] = [4, 1]  # Creates a new list objects containing [4, 1] and points s[0] there

        # s[0] ----->  [4, 1]
        # s[1] ----=>  [1]   Now, only s[1] and s[2] share a reference.
        # s[2] __/
    """
    s = [0] * 3
    s[0] += 1
    print(s)  # [1, 0, 0]

    The GCD can be computed iteratively as shown below, with the two elements
    progressively getting smaller and smaller. The use of tuple-packing and
    unpacking allows us to communicate this paired update step in one line
    without needing to use a temporary variable.

    For example, gcd(91, 35) is evaluated as follows:

    gcd(91, 35)
        a, b = 91, 35
        a, b = (35, 91 % 35) = 35, 21

    The easiest way to solve this problem is by looping over the keys and values

    to set some reasonable default value in our dictionary - in this case, a list to
    store the associated keys. Then, we can append (in-place!) our key to the list
    of keys associated to this value.

    It's possible to write this update step in one line using the default of `.get()`

        out[value] = out.get(value, []).append(key)

    However, I don't think that looks nearly as readable.

    Note: there is a tool in the `collections` module from the standard library
    called `defaultdict` which exports this functionality. You provide it a factory
    method for creating default values in the dictionary (in this case, a list.)

def comprehension_read():
    """Practice reading comprehensions and explore oddities with function calls

    Each list comprehension is replicated below with an explanation:

    [x for x in [1, 2, 3, 4]]
    # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
        Constructs a list containing exactly the elements in [1, 2, 3, 4].
        Not a very interesting list comprehension at all, since the `x for x`
        means that no transformation will happen over the range.

    [n - 2 for n in range(10)]
    # => [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
        Subtracts 2 from each of the elements in range(10). For example, the
        first element of range(10) is n = 0, so the first element of our generated
        list is n - 2 = -2. The pattern then continues for the rest of the elements.

    [k % 10 for k in range(41) if k % 3 == 0]
    # => [0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9]
        Gets the last digit of any number under 41 that is a multiple of 3.
        Note that the `if k % 3 == 0` is a filtering condition! We'll see more
        about filtering Week 4.

    [s.lower() for s in ['PythOn', 'iS', 'cOoL'] if s[0] < s[-1]]
    # => ['python']
        Builds the lowercased words if the first character is smaller than
        the last character.
        For example, when s = 'Python', we have s[0] = 'P' and s[-1] = 'n',
        and since 'P' < 'n' (compared by ASCII values), we pass our filter
        condition, and so contribute 'python' to the final list.
        On the other hand, both 'iS' and 'cOoL' do not satisfy s[0] < s[-1],
        so they are not passed to s.lower() for inclusion in the final list.

    arr = [[3,2,1], ['a','b','c'], [('do',), ['re'], 'mi']]
    print([el.append(el[0] * 4) for el in arr])
    # => [None, None, None]
    print(arr)
    # => [
      [3, 2, 1, 12],
      ['a', 'b', 'c', 'aaaa'],
      [('do',), ['re'], 'mi', ('do', 'do', 'do', 'do')]
    ]
        What's going on here? .append() is a function that returns None,
        so the list comprehension returns a list of three Nones, but the
        effect of the append still takes place - that is, the array elements
        themselves are still updated. Since 3 is an integer, 3 * 4 = 12 is
        appended to the end of the first list. Since 'a' is a string,
        'a' * 4 = 'aaaa' is appended to the end of the second list. Since
        ('do',) is a tuple, ('do',) * 4 = ('do', 'do', 'do', 'do') is appended
        to the end of the third list. Note that this is an example of duck-typing
        in action!

    [letter for letter in "pYthON" if letter.isupper()]
    # => ['Y', 'O', 'N']
        Simple enough. Keeps only the upper case letters in "pYthON", which are
        'Y', 'O', and 'N'. Interesting, the result is a list of characters, not
        a string, as you might guess. This is because the list comprehension
        traverses the string "pYthON" as a sequence of 1-character strings.

    {len(w) for w in ["its", "the", "remix", "to", "ignition"]}
    # => {2, 3, 5, 8}
        Our first set comprehension, this gives all the unique lengths of words
        in the argument list, which in this case are [3, 3, 5, 2, 8] respectively.
        Since sets don't keep duplicate elements, we're left with {2, 3, 5, 8}.

    There are many different approach to solving this problem, but the one
    shown below using a clever, little-known feature of Python list-slicing.
    List slices can be assigned into! For example,

        l = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        l[:4] = range(4)
        print(l)  # => [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    In this case, we put the first half of the word into every other character
    (slicing with a step size of 2) starting at index 0, and put the reversed
    second half of the word into every other character starting at index 1.

    Then, we can test if each letter is less than its neighbor alphabetically
    by zipping together the letters and the offset letters, and tuple-unpack
    inside the list comprehension.

    To be completely honest, a purely iterative approach would work just as
    well, if not better (less auxiliary memory, more readable), but I wanted
    to illustrate some cool features of Python (assigning into list slices as
    Lvalues, zipping a sequence with itself to generate pairs, etc).
